# Project Idea 


### Overview
My idea is a concept for a cloud-based system that backs up a user’s game save data to a cloud-based server and syncs this data 
regularly.  There is potential for this to be something that could eventually be rolled out across multiple platforms they are using.  

The idea is to provide a cloud repository for game save files in case of a number of scenarios that may occur, such as hard drive failure, 
migration to a new machine or restoring data to a re-formatted system.  As the files are being synced if there was any need to restore
them this should be able to done easily as well.   My current working title for this project is Smiling Game Saver.   

Initially there could be a free account with a limited storage size, with the option of a low subscription fee if a larger storage size was required.  There could also be potential for this to be done as a one-off service as well.   
 
### Motivation
When I think about the number of games I’ve played, and the amount of save data I could lose from a PC crash it's something I would like to try and avoid as much as possible.  All those hours and effort could be lost very easily.  Trawling through back-up archives is an option, but for an average user (including myself) this is intimidating and difficult.  A quick google search reveals there are not many options for a specific game save backup service.  I have used a client called ‘Game Save Manager’ which is very effective at organising the data saved on a local machine to a manual file.  Both back up and restoring or files has to be done manually each time, and required the user to initiate each instance.  I think having a cloud-based service that is user friendly, more streamlined in both backup and restoring data, would be a great piece of mind application that many gamers would potentially invest in.  Many current games copy local saves to a cloud-based server automatically these days, but the vast library of older games are still reliant on local saves, and there is no predicting when some companies cloud services could stop being supported.  There is still a large audience that engage in older software regularly, and the back catalogue is only going to grow.  Additional cloud-based redundancy in this area that is collated into one service could have a lot of potential, and a huge market.

### Description
 
The Client should have a very user-friendly interface, with enough information on screen and plenty of instructions available to clarify steps to the user when required.  A stage 1 roll out would focus on PC and MAC game save data.  After creating an account and performing the initial set up, the client would then scan the computer to retrieve the following:

- Operating system and PC name and specifications
- Game client installed (such as Steam, Origin, etc.) and the games associated with each client
- Non client games installed locally.

It would list the games found to the user, indicating the file path, file size, and associated client if applicable.  At this point there should be an option for the user to manually add games and file paths if they were not automatically found by the scan.  This may be required if games are not saved with the default file paths.
 
Once the index list is completed the backup is performed, and files are stored with the above information to the client server.  This could be a one-off backup and restore, or a regular sync could be set up and the frequency of this could be determined by the user, such as once a week for example.
 
As the intention is for an going game save backup service, It would be good to include functionality (whether manual or automatic) that would allow the client to identify when new games are installed.  

Any restoring of data would require the user to perform this.  The restore would be to the same file path as the original index file.  There should be a fair amount of flexibility around this as there could be lots of variables to factor, such as if the restore is to the same machine, or a new computer, or if the user wants to restore to the original file path or set their own destination.   
 
I envisage a stage 2 roll out could happen further down the track where this system is also linked with gaming consoles.  There may be restrictions around exactly what the console companies (Nintendo, Xbox, Playstation) would be willing to share to an external game save app, but it could be sold as an additional service they are offering to their players.  All these consoles already offer cloud-based game save backup data as part of their own monthly subscription service and they would not want to potentially cannibalise this, so it could be something that is only available to people on consoles if they already have a subscription service with their console, for a discounted rate.  
 
<i>Potential barriers and thoughts on feasibility:</i>
I do have some doubts that maybe there is no real need for this all-in-one service, when thinking about the future direction of games and saving methods, or people will not think this service is necessary.  It’s also a possibility that the idea is too large and has too many obstacles to be realistic in its scope.  To combat this it would be best to start small and test and learn, this will build up success stories and iron out any deficiencies so if there was a chance to partner with one of the larger companies in the future the product would be attractive. 

### Tools and technologies
- Service and account security and technology  
- User authentication and security services
- API integration between the various clients and platforms, particularly consoles.
- Server redundancy
- Patching and updating systems
- Server and Database maintenance
- Ongoing user support

### Skills required
 
- Server management
- User account security and authentication  
- Software programming - to enable scanning capability.
- Web design
- Database creation and maintenance - A great deal of research would need to go into developing and maintaining the database information for default file paths across the various operating systems
- The client would ideally have an easy update option as new titles are added, including old games being updated to various clients
- Knowledge of API integration and its potential restrictions.
- Testing and quality assurance.

## Outcome
The concept for Smiling Game Saver is very much in the ideas phase and to roll out would take a lot of work, time and money to set up and roll out, however I don’t think the market for this service is very crowded and yet the video game industry and audience is huge and constantly growing.  An application such as this that is straightforward and easy to use, should have potential for a large demographic as its audience.
