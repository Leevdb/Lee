<b>Position Description:</b>

Looking past the location requirement, I found a job listing with ZeniMax Media for a Data Analyst, effectively combining the two things I have identified earlier as my main areas of interest.  The role requires creation of reports and data analysis to determine many different factors about how games and being used.  There is also a requirement to work with other departments and areas to report effectively on their required analytics.  The role would be informing many areas of the business on current trends, and identify areas that require attention, or assist in identifying future developments or opportunities.

### Required Skills, qualifications and experience:
- 5 years of report writing and developing visualisations.  
- Thorough Knowledge of creating dashboards on Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server
- Thorough knowledge of database design
- Advanced SQL knowledge
- Time management and self organisation skills
- Strong verbal and written communication skills 
- Experience with statistics and data analysis

### Desired skills, qualifications and experience
- Previous experience as a reporting analyst for game development 
- Strong passion for gaming
- Bachelor Science degree in Computer Science, Math or Engineering
- Prior experience in an AWS environment
- Experience with Redshift, RDS, EMR
- Experience with statistical packages like R.

### My current Skills, qualifications and experience:
- Strong verbal and written communication skills 
- Some work experience with and data analysis and report writing and preparation
- Good time management and self organisation skills
- Basic understanding of database design
- Advanced Microsoft Excel

### Plan to achieve my Ideal job:

- <b>Complete Bachelor of Information Technology degree </b>- Although technically this was not listed as a required skill it would provide a lot of the knowledge required in the other required areas and strengthen the overall application.   
- <b>SQL knowledge </b>-  Learn more about programming while completing the Bachelor of Information Technology, and potentially do an SQL short course if more specific knowledge is required.  There are a lot of options for this and it’s a fairly common training course.
- <b>Build up knowledge of Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server </b>- Tableau is software that helps to visually represent data.  From a cursory look it appears to be an excel pivot table on a massive amount of steroids.  It definitely looks like software I would enjoy using.  I can sign up for a free trial , and there is free training available on the website as well.    https://www.tableau.com/learn/training.  There is also a self paced eLearning site as well https://www.tableau.com/learn/training/elearning 
- <b>Database design</b> - There will be opportunities to learn more database design as I get further into the Bachelor of Information Technology.  
- <b>Report writing and developing visualisations </b>- Although I have done a fair bit of this in my current and previous roles, as I have often worked in small businesses it would be worthwhile seeking out a role as a data analyst once I’ve acquired more knowledge  to build up this skill and understand what sort of requirements are expected from larger companies.
- <b>Experience with statistics and data analysis </b>- Again I think this is something that would be gained most successfully through having a job relating to data analysis and statistics.  I would also need to complete further study in these areas to gain a better understanding of exactly what the industry standard is.
