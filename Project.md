# Project Idea 


### Overview
My idea is a concept for a cloud-based system that backs up a userâ€™s game save data to a cloud-based server and syncs this data 
regularly.  There is potential for this to be something that could eventually be rolled out across multiple platforms they are using.  
The idea is to provide a cloud repository for game save files in case of a number of scenarios that may occur, such as hard drive failure, 
migration to a new machine or restoring data to a re-formatted system.  As the files are being synced if there was any need to restore
them this should be able to done easily as well.   My current working title for this project is Smiling Game Saver.
